How BLE connection happens:
--> the peripheral devices start advertising and send a connectable advertisment packets 
--> Central device needs be scanning for the advertisements while peripheral is advertising
--> Central devices happens tobe listening on advertisng channels then central discover the peripheral and able to read necessory inforamation in order tp establish a connection
--> Central sends a connection request 
--> Peripheral always listens for a short interval of time after it sends out the advertisement packets, this helps to receive a connection request from central and which triggers to form a connection


Coonectiomn Parameters:
what is connection interval?
The interval between two connected BLE devices wakes up the radio and exchange the data

what is slave latency?
This value helps to skip the consecutive connection events and not listens to the central at these connection events without compromising the connection.

Supervision timeout?
The max time between two received data packets before the connection considered to be lost.


what is GAP?
It is the framework which tells the behavior of BLE device
	eg: Roles of BLE devices, advertiments, connection establishment, security
	
what is GATT:
which tells how data exachange between BLE devices

what is Attribute:
	Generic term for any type of data exposed by the server, which defines the structure fo data.
	services and characteristics are Attribute

what is Service:
	Group of one or more attribute(some of which are characteristics). Group of attribute for satisfying the specific functionality on the server.
	eg: Battery service

what is chaaracteristics:
	It is a part of service, it will tell that how the data is exposed to client(Tx or Rx)
	eg: battery level in battery service

Types of characteristics:
--> Commands : Sent by the client to server, it does not require response form the server, eg: write command 
--> Request : Sent by the client to server, it requires a response from server. Eg: write request and read request.
--> Response : Sent by the server in response to a request. 
--> Notification : Sent by the server to client to let the value has been changed and for this the client need to be set the notification enable and this does not require a response from the client 
--> Indication : Same like notification but requires a ack from client to server
	Client characteristic configuration descriptor (CCCD) ==> 1 ==> Notification enable
	Client characteristic configuration descriptor (CCCD) ==> 2 ==> Indication enable
	Client characteristic configuration descriptor (CCCD) ==> 0 ==> Disable both 
--> confirmation : sent by the client to server, these are the ack for indication.
