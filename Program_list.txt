Basic:
--> Even or odd
	Num % 2 == 0 even else oddd
--> Prime num, print Prime num from 0 to N
	Is prime:
		loop: i = 2 to sqrt(num) 
			num % i == 0
			flag
			break;
		print prime or not
	
--> Leap year ==> num % 4 == 0 || num % 400 = 0 && num % 100 != 0

--> Factorial ==> 5! ==> 5 * 4 * 3 * 4 * 2 * 1 == > 120
 
--> Fibbonacci, Print Fibb upto N 
	Fibb ==> 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 if n == 10 ==> 1,1,2,3,5,8 

--> Palindrome==> 121 == 121

--> add digits of num 1234 => 10

--> print n natural numbers

--> sqaure of N natural numbers, Cube

--> multiply two number without using * operator

--> reverse the number

--> Check if n is power of N or not

Loops: Pyramid



strings:
--> strlen
--> strcpy
--> strrev (using rec, fun)
--> strcmp
--> strcat
--> strstr
--> strtok


array:
--> search
--> sort
--> delete_duplicates using array 
--> remove freq characters

--> MACRO programs (send ++ with value)
--> bitwise programs
	--> set bit, clear bit

what is the dfifference bitween typedef and Macro?
	--> Macro will replace the values what we have used in program eg: #define val 5 ==> In program will use val not the 5
	--> In typedef will use the new type the program will replace the original type eg: typedef unsigned int Uint ==> In program will use Uint, program will replace the  original data type 


--> structure and union, padding, packing, some programs 

--> enum and bitfields
	--> Enum is used assign integer const -==> 4byte in size
		enum week{sun, mon......sat};
	--> Bit fields: assign in struct eg==> struct stru {
					unsigned int d : 5;

--> inline function and MACRO difference
	--> basically inline function are parsed by compiler and Macro expanded by preprocessor
		--> Inline : It execute the fun but keeps the param values as it is  
		--> Macro: In macro it evaluate and replaces the latest value in program
--> what is difference between character array and string

--> threads 









This is makadchap
