=================================UART==========================

--> Its a Full duplex 
--> Its peer to peer commn

==> Data format/bit frame
    --> Its 10 bit data format ==> 1 start bit 8 data bit 1 stop bit
    --> Some times its 11 bit format ==> 1 start bit, 8 data bit, 1 parity bit, 1 stop bit ==> parity bit is used for error frame detection
                                                  --> If Parity bit is set 1 and data byte frame should contain odd numbers of 1's
                                                  --> If Parity bit is set 0 and data byte frame should contain evn numbers of 1's  
    --> Older UART devices are slow in data communication then the UART uses two stop bits at each data transmission, just the RX devices gets ready for communication


==> Bit frame structure
            --> start,8 bit data,stop bit
            --> start bit ==> Its pulls the Tx line low 1010 1000
            --> 8 bit data ==> LSB to MSB ==> 0xA8 ==> 00010101
            --> stop bit --> it release the Tx line to high
         complete flow ==>  0 00010101 1
